# Hello and welcome! ðŸ˜„  
My name is **Gagandeep Singh**.

#### Iâ€™m a passionate Full-Stack Developer and the founder of **Boldally**, with over 11 years of experience building web and mobile applications.

I enjoy turning ideas into clean, high-performance solutions using technologies like **Go**, **PHP**, **Node.js**, **Laravel**, **Flutter**, **React**, and **Vue.js**. Whether it's working on the backend or designing smooth user interfaces, I really enjoy the craft of development.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into **real-time applications**, **AI integration**, and exploring **Rust**â€”always looking for ways to build better, faster, and more reliable software.
